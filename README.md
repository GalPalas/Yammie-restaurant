# Yammie restaurant

Intro:
Yammie restaurant has recently gained a huge success and popularity and
would like to expand and start offering their services online.
They want to optimize their ordering process, and in order to achieve the
best optimization, they have already developed a Client solution based on
React.
At this point they reached out to us and asked our developers to implement
a Backend API to manage their orders.
